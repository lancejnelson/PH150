        "## Conservation of Energy\n",
        "Conseravtion of energy is one of the most fundamental and well-established ideas in physics. It states that the **total** energy of an isolated system must remain fixed and unchanged as time progresses.  If one type of energy decreases, the amount of another type of energy must increase so that the total energy never changes.  This week you will design an experiment to prove this hypothesis.  You can choose between two experiments: a sphere rolling down an incline or a simple pendulum.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sphere on an Incline\n",
        "A sphere that rolls down an incline will gain kinetic energy (both translational and rotational) as it loses gravitational potential energy (because its height is decreasing).  Mathematically, this can be stated as\n",

        "$$ U_i = K_f$$\n",
        "where $U_i = M g y$ is the initial potential energy of the sphere and $K_f ={1\\over 2} M v^2 + {1\\over 2} I {v^2\\over r^2}$ is the total kinetic energy of the sphere at the bottom of the incline.  Plugging these in and reducing gives.. \n",
        "$$M g y = {1\\over 2} M v^2 + {1\\over 2} I {v^2\\over r^2}$$\n",
        "$$M g y = {1\\over 2} M v^2 + {1\\over 2} c M r^2 {v^2\\over r^2}$$\n",

        "$$ y = {v^2\\over 2 g} (1 + c)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Here $c$ is the constant in the moment of inertial value and should be equal to ${2 \\over 5}$ for a sphere.  Your goal if you choose this experiment is to design an experiment that proves that this relationship is true and to calculate a value for $c$ with its uncertainty.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Simple Pendulum\n",
        "The motion of a pendulum is also a good illustration of the concept of conservation of energy. When the pendulum bobs is at its highest point, it is briefly motionless and hence has no kinetic energy. It only has potential energy.  Then, as the pendulum swings downward its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.  In order for energy to be conserved, these two energies should be equal.\n",
