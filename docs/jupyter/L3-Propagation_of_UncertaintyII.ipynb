        "1. Use basic LaTeX syntax to write simple mathematical equations.\n",
        "1. Use Sympy to calculate derivatives.\n",
        "2. Propagate uncertainty for complex equations using the equation $$ \\delta q =  \\sqrt{({\\partial q \\over \\partial a} \\delta a)^2 + ({\\partial q \\over \\partial b} \\delta b)^2 + \\dots}$$\n",

        "## Background\n",
        "Last week we learned about partial derivatives and how they can be used to calculate uncertainties in calculated quantities.   The most important equation for propagation of uncertainty is   $$ \\delta q =  \\sqrt{({\\partial q \\over \\partial a} \\delta a)^2 + ({\\partial q \\over \\partial b} \\delta b)^2 + \\dots}$$  It's not hard to find a situations that result in very difficult (and very messy) partial derivatives. This week we'll continue to use this equation to propagate uncertainty but we'll use Python to calculate the derivatives.\n",
        "  Python can calculate derivatives for you using a module called `sympy` (short for symbolic python).  To use `sympy` to calculate derivatives, follow the the following steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Step 1: Define the variables that are in the expression that you want to differentiate.\n",
        "2. Step 2: Define the expression that you want to differentiate.\n",
        "3. Step 3: Use `sympy`'s diff function to perform the differentiation.\n",
        "4. Step 4: Use `subs` to evaluate the derivative for given value of the variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "To see how this works, let's follow these steps to differentiate the following function. $$z(x,y) = {x^2 \\over y}$$.  Study the code cell below to see how this is done."

Complete the mathematical statements below with the expressions for these derivatives. $${\\partial v_i \\over \\partial g} = $$ $${\\partial v_i \\over \\partial h} = $$\n",

The expression for uncertainty propagation for $v_i$ is  $$ \\delta v_i =  \\sqrt{({\\partial v_i \\over \\partial g} \\delta g)^2 + ({\\partial v_i \\over \\partial h} \\delta h)^2}$$  This calculation is performed on line 17 in the code cell below.  Study the code and ask questions so you can recreate this in activity II."

        "#### Setup\n",
        "1. Set your cannon on a table and aim it in a direction so that the projectile won't hit anything (or anyone).\n",
        "2. Choose an initial launch angle and speed setting. Then adjust your cannon to match these choices.  Record your launch angle with its associated uncertainty (in radians) in the code cell below.\n",
        "3. Transfer the initial velocity and uncerainty that you found from activity I into the code cell below.\n",
        "4. Measure the distance from the ground to the projectile's point of exit.  Record this number with its associated uncertainty in the code cell below.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Calculations\n",
        "5. You may recall the following kinematic equations from your PH121 class.   $$x_f = x_i + v_i \\cos(\\theta) t$$ $$y_f = y_i + v_i \\sin(\\theta) t -{1\\over 2} g  t^2$$ Use the second of these equations to find an expression for the projectile's flight time in terms of $y_i$, $v_i$, $\\theta$,  and $g$. Fill in the equation below with your answer. **Hint:** You will have to solve a quadratic equation.$$ t = $$\n",
        "6. Following the same pattern used on line 9 in the code cell above, enter the expression that you found in part 5 on line 18 of the code cell below. Use `sp.sqrt()` for square root expressions and `sp.sin()` for sine expressions.   \n",
        "7. To find the uncertainty in the flight time, you'll need to evaluate four partial derivatives: ${\\partial t \\over \\partial v_i}$, ${\\partial t \\over \\partial \\theta}$, ${\\partial t \\over \\partial g}$, and ${\\partial t \\over \\partial y_i}$. We'll let python calculate these derivatives, following the same pattern shown in activity I. Fill in lines 20 - 23 in the code cell below with the appropriate code to calculate the four relevant derivatives. (They will look similar to lines 11 and 12 from the code cell above.)\n",
        "8. The expression for the uncertainty in the flight time is given by:$$ \\delta t = \\sqrt{({\\partial t \\over \\partial v_i} \\delta v_i)^2 + ({\\partial t \\over \\partial \\theta} \\delta \\theta)^2 + ({\\partial t \\over \\partial y_i} \\delta y_i)^2 + ({\\partial t \\over \\partial g} \\delta g)^2}$$  Fill in line 29 in the code cell below with the appropriate code to calculate this expression. (It will be similar to line 17 from the code cell above)\n",
        "9. Now that you have the flight time with its uncertainty, you can use the first kinematic equation from above to calculate the projectile's landing location.  Fill in the equation below with an expression for the landing location $x_f$ in terms of $v_i$, $\\theta$, and $t$.  $$x_f = $$\n",
        "10. To find the uncertainty in the landing location, you'll need to evaluate three partial derivatives: ${\\partial x_f \\over \\partial v_i}$, ${\\partial x_f \\over \\partial \\theta}$, and ${\\partial x_f \\over \\partial t}$. We'll let python calculate these derivatives, following the same pattern from activity I. Fill in lines 35 - 37 in the code cell below with the appropriate code to calculate the three relevant derivatives.(They will look similar to lines 11 and 12 from the code cell above.)\n",
        "11. The expression for the uncertainty in the landing location:$$ \\delta x_f = \\sqrt{({\\partial x_f \\over \\partial v_i} \\delta v_i)^2 + ({\\partial x_f \\over \\partial \\theta} \\delta \\theta)^2 + ({\\partial x_f \\over \\partial t} \\delta t)^2}$$  Fill in line 43 in the code cell below with the appropriate code to calculate this expression. (It will be similar to line 17 from the code cell above)\n",
        "12. Evaluate the code cell below and observe the results.  By experimenting with the uncertainties in measured values, can you determine which variable has the greatest affect on the uncertainty in the projectile's landing location?  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### Experiment and Analysis\n",
        "13. Put a piece of carbon paper on the floor at your predicted landing location. Draw a circle on the carbon paper to reflect the uncertainty in your prediction. Then launch the projectile and observe where it lands. Measure the distance to the landing location with its associated uncertainty and record it in the second code cell below. Put your names on the carbon paper and hand it in to B. Nelson.\n",
        "14. Using a stop watch, measure the time of flight with it's associated uncertainty. (Don't forget to consider your reaction time when assigning the uncertainty.) Record these values in the code cell below.\n",
        "15. Evaluate the second code cell below and, after observing the results, answer the following questions about your experiment in the area marked \"Response\" below: \n",
        "    1. Do your predictions and measurements agree to within your stated uncertainty?\n",
        "    2. If your observations did not match your predictions to within your stated uncertainties, comment on why you think it was?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    > Response:\n",
        "16. Take a minute to inspect all of the code that I have given to you today.  Ask questions about code that you don't understand.  As some point, you'll have to recreate code like this on your own."
