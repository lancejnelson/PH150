        "In 1826, J.K.F Sturm and J.D. Collandon designed an experiment to calculate the speed of sound in seawater.  The two men sat in boats separated by 16 kilometers.  A bell was suspended in the lake from Sturm's boat which could be struck by a hammer that was operated by Sturm at the surface.  At the exact moment that the hammer struck the bell it also ignited some gun powder which produced an above-water flash.  An underwater ear-trumpet was suspended from Collandon's boat  to receive the sound wave emitted by the bell.  By measuring the time difference between the flash and the bell's tone, the scientists were able to calculate the speed of sound to be $1435$ m/s, which was remarkably close to the modern value of $1438$ m/s. \n",

        "\n",
        " \n",
        "If this experiment had been repeated many times the results would have been slightly different every time.  This is because experiments always involve measurements, and measurements always have some variability (or uncertainty) associated with them.  For example, to measure the difference in time between the bell and the flash involves the use of a watch and a human to operate that watch. A simple analog watch may be able to measure to the nearest second or maybe half second but no smaller.  Typical reaction times for humans varies between $0.17$ s (audio stimulus) and $0.25$ s (visual stimulus). Another important measurement that would surely have some variation is the distance between the boats (reported to be $16$ km).  Variations in the water temperature and pressure could also change the true value of the speed of sound and therefore make the time measurements differ.  Although there is only one true value for the speed of sound in fresh water (at a given temperature and pressure) multiple measurements of this quantity will never be identical.  This is represented in the figure below, which is an example of what multiple measurements of the speed of sound may have looked like for Sturm and Collandon.  Each vertical bar gives the number of times that the measured speed of sound occurred at that value."

        "width.  Therefore, even if the end of the rod landed on a tick mark,\n",

        "$10.555$ kg. Anything in that range would have rounded to $10.55$ kg.\n",
        "Hence, the uncertainty on this measurement is $\\pm 0.005$\n",
        "kg.  This measurement would be reported as $10.55 \\pm .005$ kg.  Unless otherwise stated on the device, the uncertainty of a digital measurement is half of the value of the\n",
        "last decimal place shown.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Other Sources of Uncertainty\n",
        "Sometimes the biggest source of uncertainty in a measurement is not due to the instrument itself but the experimental setup.  For example, if a digital timer is used to time the drop of a tennis ball, the reaction time of the person operating the timer will be bigger than the explicit uncertainty in the timer itself. (For reference, the typical reaction time for auditory stimuli is $0.14 - 0.16$ s and $0.18 - 0.2$ for visual stimuli.)  The placement of a meter stick may vary from measurement to measurement due to human variability and this would introduce some variability in the subsequent measurements.   Fluctuations in the environmental conditions (temperature, pressure, etc) can cause variability in measurements.  All of these factors must be considered when assigning uncertainties to measured values. \n",

        "everyday language they tend to be synonymous. They are precision and\n",
        "accuracy.  Precision is a measure of the uncertainty in a measurement.\n",
        "In other words, high precision means low uncertainty. Accuracy, on the other hand, means a measurement agrees well with an accepted standard. The figure below illustrates the concept of precision vs. accuracy when throwing darts at a dartboard.   \n",
        "\n",
        "When  all of your measurements are offset from the true value (blue dots in the figure) we call it a *systematic error*.  An example of a systematic error would be using a measuring tape on a hot day.  Because the length of the measuring tape has thermally expanded, any measurements taken will be smaller than they should be.  There is no way to detect a systematic error by simply gathering data; you must uncover it based on the experimental circumstances. \n",

Fractional uncertainties of $1\\%$ of $2\\%$ are characteristic of reasonably careful measurements and are about the best we can hope for in any lab that we do.  Fractional uncertainties less that $1\\%$ will be difficult to achieve in an introductory lab setting.\n",
