        "### Goal:  \n",
        "By taking measurements on a simple pendulum, calculate the acceleration due to gravity with its associated uncertainty.  Compare to the known value for Rexburg.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Procedure:  \n",
        "1. Assemble five pendulums of different lengths, with the lengths ranging from $0.25$ m to $2.0$ m.  \n",
        "2. For each pendulum, perform the following:  \n",
        "   1. Measure the distance from the support point to the center of the pendulum.  This is the length of the pendulum $L$.  Assign an uncertainty to this measurement.\n",
        "   2. Release the pendulum from a small initial angle (no bigger than $15^\\circ$ from the vertical) and use the photogate to measure the period $T$ of the pendulum with its associated uncertainty. (The period of a pendulum is the time it take to make one full cycle.)\n",
        "   3. Place all of your lengths and periods and their uncertainties into numpy arrays.\n",
        "3. Calculate the acceleration due to gravity ($g$) using $g = {4 \\pi^2 L \\over T^2}$.\n",
        "4. Using the methods discussed above determine the equation for calculating the uncertainty in $g$.  Use $\\LaTeX$ syntax to complete the math equation below $$ \\delta g = $$\n",
        "5. Calculate the uncertainty and **fractional uncertainty** in $g$ in the code cell below.\n",
        "8. Put your data in a dataframe and display the dataframe to visually verify that it has 10 rows and 6 columns. The columns should be $L$, $T$, $g$ and their uncertainties.  Give the appropriate names. \n",
        "9. Construct a multi-figure plot containing two plots.  The first plot should be period vs length and the other plot should be g vs. length. The points on both plots should have error bars attached.\n",
        "10. Add axes labels and titles to both of your plots. \n",
        "11. Analyze the results to answer the following questions:  \n",
        "  1. Which result has the lowest uncertainty? Can you explain why?  \n",
        "  2. What function do you think best represents the relationship between $L$ and $T$?(We will study curve-fitting in a later lab.)  \n",
        "  3. The accepted value of $g$ for Rexburg is $g = 9.80056$ m/s$^2$.  Do your calculations agree with this value to within your calculated uncertainties?  \n",
