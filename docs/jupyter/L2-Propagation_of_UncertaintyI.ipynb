Let's imagine that we'd like to know the slope of this function at $t = 0.2$ s.  We can make a first attempt at this by finding the slope of the line that passes through the points at $t= 0.2$ and $t = 0.45$ (top left plot).  Improvements to this can be made by slowly bringing these two points closer together. Eventually, the two points become so close together that the resulting line is tangent to the function at $t= 0.2$.  The slope of this function at $t = 0.2$ is equal to the tangent line at that point.  \n"
