        "Last week we used a `for` loop with Euler's method, which was a good first choice because its easy to understand.  However a `for` loop is often a clunky approach because we often don't know how many iterations need to be performed to achieve the desired result.  For example, last week we showed an example of Euler's method for a particle launched straight upward and allowed to travel up and then come back down and hit the ground.  Instead of performing a specified number of iterations of this loop, it would be nice to let the loop continue until the particle hit the ground.  We can do this with a `while` loop which has the following basic structure:"

        "\n",
        "`while` loops should be used with caution because you can easily write a *faulty stopping condition* and inadvertently write a loop that runs forever.  This happens because your stopping condition was never met.  For example, if the statement `n = n + 1` were omitted in the code above, `n` would never change and the stopping condition `n < 20` would never evaluate to `False` and the loop will run forever.  To avoid this, you should always get in the habit of building a fail safe into your while loops.  To build a fail safe, first define a variable that counts the number of loop iterations.  Then add an `if` statement inside the loop body to check to see if the value of the counter variable becomes too large.  A `break` statement is used in this case to exit the loop.  Below is an example of the loop above with faulty termination logic but with a fail safe to prevent it from looping forever.\n"

        "Using the uncertainties that you assigned to your measured values from Activity I, use Euler's method to calculate the uncertainty in the flight time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Procedure\n",
        "To incorporate uncertainty into Euler's method, you must repeat your Euler's loop many times using different values for those quantities that carry uncertainty.  In the code cell below you will find a template for doing this.  Follow the instructions below to complete the task.  \n",
        "\n",
        "1. You'll notice that the variable names in the code cell have been modified from what they were in Activity I. Instead of \"mb\" for mass of the balloon, we now have \"meanmb\" for mean mass of the balloon and \"dmb\" for uncertainty (or standard deviation) in the mass of the balloon. Transfer all of your measurements and uncertainties from Activity I into the code cell below.\n",
        "2. If you haven't yet, record the uncertainties in all of your measured values in the code cell below.\n",
        "3. You'll notice that our Euler's loop from Activity I is now enclosed in a `for` loop .  This will allow us to repeat the Euler's loop as many times as we would like. We call the Euler's loop the \"inner\" loop and the 'for' loop the \"outer\" loop. The first five lines in the outer loop are to select a random number for each of the variables that carry uncertainty.  I've given an example of how to do this on the first line for the balloon mass.  Repeat this same process to select random numbers for the other five quantities that carry uncertainty.\n",
        "4. Fill in the correct expressions for the remainder of the code lines that are incomplete.  (Most of these lines will be identical to what they were in Activity I.)\n",
        "5. Check with a neighbor or B. Nelson to verify that you did it correctly.\n",
        "6. Run your code and observe the results. Notice the spread in travel times depicted on the position vs. time graph. (Cool eh!)\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: The uncertainty in your balloon diameter will be the biggest contributor to the uncertainty in the predicted flight time.  "
