        "### Goal (Overview)\n",
        "Modify your code from last week to incorporate the buoyant force experienced by the weather balloon.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Procedure\n",
        "1. Measure the mass of the balloon before we fill it with helium. Record a value and an uncertainty. \n",
        "2. We'll be adding a small payload to the balloon and adjusting it until the time of flight falls in a reasonable range.  For now, set the mass of the payload to be $m_p = 15$ grams.  We'll modify this number later.\n",
        "3. Measure the temperature in the room and **assign an uncertainty to this measurement**.  Convert this temperature to Kelvins using the equation below. Then record this number in the code cell provided below.\n",
        "$$ T_K = {5 \\over 9}(T_F - 32) + 273.15$$\n",
        "4.  Visit a weather website to look up the atmospheric pressure here in Rexburg.  You'll probably see a number with units of \"inHg\", which means \"inches of Mercury\". To convert this pressure into Pascals, use the equation below. (The $4.865$ is to undo the sea-level correction and the $3386.39$ is to convert from \"inHg\" to Pascals.)   Record this value in the code cell provided below. \n",
        "$$ P_\\text{Pa} = 3386.39 \\times (P_\\text{inHg} - 4.865) $$\n",
        "5. Enter values for $T_0$ $P_0$ in the code cell below using the values shown above.\n",
        "6. Enter the expression for density given above into the code cell provided below for the density of air and helium.\n",
        "7. Enter the expression for $V$ and $A$ in the code cell below in terms of $d$ (diameter).\n",
        "8. Enter the expression for $F_b$ (the buoyant force) in the code cell below using the equation provided above.\n",
        "9. Enter the expression for $F_g$ (the weights) in the code cell below using the equation provided above.\n",
        "10. Enter the expression for $F_D$ (the drag force) in the code cell below using the equation provided above.  As a reminder, the equation should be:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "{1\\over 2} \\; C \\rho A |v| v\n",
        "$$\n",
        "11. Enter the expression for $a$ (the acceleration) in the code cell below using the equation provided above.  Note that since the acceleration is not constant the calculation must be performed inside the main Euler's loop.\n",
        "12. Following the same pattern from last week, add expressions to update the velocity, position, and time inside the main Euler's loop.\n",
        "13. Check with your neighbor and/or B. Nelson to ensure you have done these steps correctly before moving on.\n",
        "14. Have B. Nelson fill your balloon with helium.  Once it is filled, devise a method for determining the diameter of the balloon. Record the value and its uncertainty in the code cell below. (Note: The helium will slowly diffuse out of the balloon, so you won't want much time to pass between when you fill your balloon and when you test your prediction)\n",
        "15. Run your code and verify that your results are reasonable.\n",
        "16. Using trial and error, adjust the mass of the payload until the time of flight is in the $6-10$ seconds range."

        "\n",
        "1. You'll notice that the variable names in the code cell have been modified from what they were in Activity I. Instead of \"mb\" for mass of the balloon, we now have \"meanmb\" for mean mass of the balloon and \"dmb\" for uncertainty (or standard deviation) in the mass of the balloon. Transfer all of your measurements and uncertainties from Activity I into the code cell below.\n",
        "2. If you haven't yet, record the uncertainties in all of your measured values in the code cell below.\n",
        "3. You'll notice that our Euler's loop from Activity I is now enclosed in a `for` loop .  This will allow us to repeat the Euler's loop as many times as we would like. We call the Euler's loop the \"inner\" loop and the 'for' loop the \"outer\" loop. The first five lines in the outer loop are to select a random number for each of the variables that carry uncertainty.  I've given an example of how to do this on the first line for the balloon mass.  Repeat this same process to select random numbers for the other five quantities that carry uncertainty.\n",

        "6. Run your code and observe the results. Notice the spread in travel times depicted on the position vs. time graph. (Cool eh!)\n",
        "7. By modifying the uncertainties in your input variables, determine which variable affects the uncertainty in your travel time the most."
