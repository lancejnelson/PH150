        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a computer programming language available on all major platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux).  Python is a scripting language which means that the computer interprets and runs your code at the moment you run it.  In contrast, with a compiled language like C the code must first be converted into binary before it can run (called \"compiling\" the code).  There are pros and cons to both types of languages. The on-the-fly interpretation of Python makes it quick and easy to write code and provides fast results for simple calculations.  When codes become longer and more complex, on-the-fly interpretation becomes less efficient and execution time will be much slower than it would be with a compiled language.  The pros and cons flip for a compiled language; writing code in a compiled language can be cumbersome and slow, but the execution time is typically much faster.  Out of necessity, most programmers become proficient in both types of languages.  Python(or another interpreted language) is used to \"toy around\" with your problem and build familiarity.  As the complexity of the code increases the user is then forced to transition to a compiled language to get the needed speed. This is the famous \"two language\" problem and there is a new programming language designed to eliminate this problem by combining the pros from both into one language. (The name of the language is [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/))\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is free, open source software and is maintained by the non-profit Python software foundation.  This is great because it means that you will always have free access to the Python language regardless of what organization or university you are affiliated with.  You'll never have to worry about not being able to use your Python code without paying for it.  Another benefit of open source languages is that all of the codes developed by other people are available for anyone to inspect, modify, and use.  This allows anyone to review another's code to ensure that it does what they say it does, or to modify it to do something else.  One last benefit that comes with an open source language is the community of Python users available to answer questions and provide instruction to the beginner. Answers to most questions about python are readily available on tutorial or forum websites.  \n",

        "## Installing Software\n",
        "The first step is to install the software (if you haven't already). The most convenient way to install Python and also get many of the commonly-used libraries is to use an installer. I recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/\"). When installing the software be sure to choose Python 3 since this is the current version.  By default, Anaconda will install a suit of softwares and libraries that are commonly used.  If you want to install other Python libraries, open the Anaconda-Navigator (green circle icon) and select the **Environment** tab on the left.  Select **Not Installed** from the pull-down to see all of the libraries that are available to be installed.  To install a library, check the box next to it and click **Apply**.  Anaconda will take care of the rest. \n",

        "To launch a Jupyter notebook, first open Anaconda-Navigator (green circle icon) and click the **Launch** button under JupyterLab.  Jupyter can also be launched from the command line by typing `jupyter-lab`.  The jupyter notebook will launch in your default web browser, but it is not a website.  From here you can select an already existing Jupyter notebook, denoted by the orange icons and the .ipynb extension, or create a new notebook by clicking **New** from the **File** menu.\n",

        "\n",
        "Navigating a Jupyter notebook is fairly straightforward but there are a few handy shortcuts/hotkeys that will make navigation quicker and your workflow more efficient.  When working in a Jupyter notebook, you are always operating in one of two modes: edit mode or navigate mode.  In edit mode you can make modifications to the text or code in a cell and in navigate mode you can add/delete cells and modify the cell type.  If you can see a blinking cursor in one of the cells you are in edit mode.  Otherwise you are in navigate mode.  To exit edit mode, simply press the `esc` key and you will enter navigate mode.   To exit navigate mode, simply press the `enter` key and you will enter edit mode for the cell you were focused on. (You can also double click on a cell with your mouse to enter edit mode.)   The `shift` + `enter` key sequence will \"execute\" a cell and produce the associated output.  For text cells, executing just means to render the text in a nicely formatted fashion.  \"Executing\" a code cell will actually execute the code block contained in the cell.  You also enter navigate mode every time you execute a cell using the `shift` + `enter` key sequence. A summary of these shortcuts is given below:\n",

        "- `A` - inserts a new cell above the current cell.\n",
