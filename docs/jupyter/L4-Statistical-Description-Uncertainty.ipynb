        "2. Stopwatch (the one on your phone will do)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Goal (Overview)\n",
        "Each student will measure the period of a 1.5-meter-long pendulum 10 times. This will result in a set of ~150 data points for the whole class.  We will then calculate the acceleration due to gravity for each measurement and calculate the  i) mean, ii) standard deviation, and iii) standard deviation of the mean and use these results to report an appropriate uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Procedure\n",
        "1. A pendulum that is 1.5 meters long will be set up at the front of the class. Each person should measure the period of the pendulum with a stopwatch 10 times. Data should be recorded to the nearest 0.01 s.  For the best results try to keep the pendulum's amplitude consistent for all of the measurements, even by restarting as necessary.  The amplitude should be relatively small (less than about $10^\\circ$).  The pendulum should be swinging (rather than at rest) when the time measurement begins.\n",
        "2. Record your 10 measurements in the google sheets link provided below.\n",
        "3. Once everyone has collected their measurements someone needs to move all of the data into a single column.  Then download the file to your computer, saving it as a .csv file.  Then use the `np.loadtxt()` function to read this data into Python. Do this on line 7 of the code cell below.  (Remember: The file must be located in the same directory as this Jupyter notebook.)\n",
        "4. The acceleration due to gravity can be calculated from $$ g = {4 \\pi^2 L \\over T^2}$$ On line 9 of the code cell below calculate the acceleration due to gravity for each period measurement in the data set. To include $\\pi$ in your calculation use `np.pi`.\n",
        "5. Use the equations given in the reading above to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and standard deviation of the mean.  Perform these calculations on lines 10, 11, and 12 of the code cell below.  Use `np.sum()` to perform summations and `np.sqrt()` to perform square root functions.\n",
        "6. On lines 14,15, and 16 in the code cell below use the functions `stats.mean()` and `stats.stdev()` to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and standard deviation of the mean.  \n",
        "7. Construct a dataframe of data with the period located in the first column and the values of g in the second column.\n",
        "8. A statistical analysis of the data can be generated using `dataframe.describe()`, which creates a new dataframe containing often used statistics.  Do this on line.  \n",
        "7. Add a formatted print statement  to report an appropriate value for $g$ with its uncertainty.\n",
        "8. Plot a histogram of the g values.  \n",
        "9. The normal distribution is given by $$ N(x) = {1\\over \\sigma \\sqrt{2 \\pi}} e^{-(x- \\mu)^2\\over 2 \\sigma^2}$$. Plot this distribution on top of the histogram. Verify that the limiting distribution matches the histogram.  \n",
        "10. Calculate the p-value for this dataset using $g= 9.8$ as the expected value.  State whether the deviation of your experimental results are significant enough (at the $5\\%$ level ) to reject the experiment. Do this on line 22 in the code cell below.\n",
