        "We've learned that all measurements have uncertainties associated with them.  This means that when a measurement (or experiment) is repeated, the obtained value is different every time.  Statisticians call this a random variable, but the numbers aren't as random as you might think.  You might think that the word random means that the value can be **anything**; any number at all from $-\\infty \\rightarrow \\infty$ but that's not what we typically mean.  Instead, random in this context means a number that is random but subject to some probability rules.\n",

The number of measurements in all of the bins can be visualized by plotting a bar for each bin, with the height of the bar indicating how many measurements were in the bin.

First notice the quantity $x_i - \\mu$, which is a measure of how far away each data point is from the mean.  Summing up these differences would be some indication to the amount of spread in the data.

However, the standard deviation does not decrease as $N$ increases.  Even though $N$ is on the denominator of the expression, as $N$ increases so too does the numerator.

        "In lab #1, the success of an experiment was decided by comparing the fractional uncertainty to the percent error. If the fractional uncertainty was bigger than the percent error then the experiment was judged to be a success.  While this criteria isn't wrong, it doesn't tell us how good or bad the agreement is and it also doesn't provide any boundary between acceptable and unacceptable results. We are now in a position to describe a more robust criteria for judging success.\n",

This distribution is assumed to be **centered at the expected value ($x_e$)**. If the results of the experiment (usually the mean) are too far away from the expected mean, the probability that the measurements were random draws from the assumed distribution is so small that we lose confidence in that assumption.  The figure below illustrates this idea.  The red curve is the assumed distribution centered at the expected value and the blue bars indicate the measurements during the experiment.  The mean of these results is indicated by the red dashed curve and the expected mean is indicated by the green dashed curve."

The amplitude should be relatively small (less than about $10^\\circ$).  The pendulum should be swinging (rather than at rest) when the time measurement begins.\n",
