        "1. We don't know exact values for the drag coefficient ($C$) or the projectile's exit speed. Make a guess for now and we'll modify these values later.\n",
        "2. Previously, we have modeled one-dimensional motion which means we only had to calculate a single component of the position and velocity.  To model two-dimensional motion, you'll have to have two components of the position and velocity.  \n",
        "3. To calculate the drag force in two dimensions, you'll need to calculate the **speed** (magnitude of the velocity vector) of the projectile as it changes.  Since you are tracking the components of your velocity, you can do that with the following code `numpy.sqrt(vx**2 + vy**2)` or `numpy.linalg.norm([vx,vy])`\n",
        "4. Once you have finished the code, run it and observe the family of trajectories that result.  Then investigate how the following variables affect the shape of the trajectory and the spread in the trajectories:\n",

A good way to do this is to use a high-speed camera (the one on your phone will probably do) and film the ball dropping.  Then use the LoggerPro software (free download or already installed on the lab computers) to plot the velocity vs. time graph and determine the terminal velocity $v_T$. You should drop the ball from a height that give the ball enough time to reach terminal velocity well before it hits the floor.  The drag constant can then be calculated using the following equation:\n",

If the laser isn’t perfectly aligned with the center of the ball as it goes through, then the part of the ball that blocks the laser will be shorter than the diameter (i.e. less ball will travel through the laser beam). With a bit of geometry, you can show that $d_\\text{beam} =d_\\text{ball}\\sqrt{1 - \\alpha^2}$ where $d_\\text{beam}$ is the amount of ball that went through the beam, $d_\\text{ball}$ is the actual diameter of the ball, and $\\alpha$ is how far from the center of the ball the beam is (as a ratio of the radius).\n",
        "Here’s an example on how to use this equation: If the diameter of the ball were $2$ cm, and I think that I can confidently keep the laser within $0.5$ cm of the center of the ball (50% of the radius), the smallest diameter that I would expect to pass through the beam would be:\n",
