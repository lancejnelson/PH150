        "As an example, consider a car that is initially at rest, waiting for the stoplight to turn green.  Once the light turns green, the driver presses on the accelerator and the car's speed begins to increase. After accelerating at a rate of $a = 5$ m/s$^2$ for $t = 3$ s, the driver eases up and reduces the acceleration to more modest $a = 2$ m/s$^2$ and maintains this acceleration for another $\\Delta t = 8$ s.  How would you determine the speed of the car and its location after the full $11$ seconds had elapsed?  The kinematic equations above could be applied to the first 3 seconds of the trip or the last 8 seconds of the trip, but couldn't be applied from the start to the end. Let's use the kinematic equations to determine the speed and position after the first 3 seconds.\n",

        "Euler's method works in exactly the same as above with one small change; when using the kinematic equations, we use a time step ($\\Delta t$) that is very small.  We do this because if the time step is very small, the acceleration can be treated as if it were constant even if it changes dramatically over longer time intervals. Most realistic scenarios involve accelerations that change **continuously**, which means that it is constantly changing.  The steps to implement Euler's method have the following basic steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Define the initial conditions.  For particle motion this involves defining the initial position and velocity of the object as well as any other variable that **do not change** over time.\n",
        "2. Repeatedly calculate the following quantities.\n",
        "   1. The current acceleration. The acceleration function is typically given to you or can be derived from Newton's law. This expression will always be a function of time,position, and/or velocity and must be re-evaluated every time you advance by a time step.\n",
        "   2. Use a kinematic equation to calculate the next position using the previous position and velocity.\n",
        "   3. Use a kinematic equation to calculate the next velocity using the previous position and velocity.\n",
        "   4. If you want to store all of your positions and velocities for later use, add them to a list.\n",
