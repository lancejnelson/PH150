        "As an example, consider a car that is initially at rest, waiting for the stoplight to turn green.  Once the light turns green, the driver presses on the accelerator and the car's speed begins to increase. After accelerating at a rate of $a = 5$ m/s$^2$ for $t = 3$ s, the driver eases up and reduces the acceleration to a more modest $a = 2$ m/s$^2$ and maintains this acceleration for another $\\Delta t = 8$ s.  How would you determine the position and speed of the car after the full $11$ seconds had elapsed?  The kinematic equations above could be applied to the first 3 seconds of the trip or to the last 8 seconds of the trip, but couldn't be applied from the start to the end. Let's use the kinematic equations to determine the speed and position after the first 3 seconds.\n",

        "Most realistic scenarios involve accelerations that change **continuously**, not discretely like the examples above.  However, we can still employ the method used above if we use a time step ($\\Delta t$) that is very small.  Even if the acceleration varies substantially over long time intervals, it will always be nearly constant over very small time steps.  We call this Euler's method and the steps to implement Euler's method are as follows:\n",

        "1. Define the initial conditions.  For particle motion this involves defining the initial position and velocity of the object as well as any other variable that **do not change** over time.\n",

        "   1. The current acceleration. The acceleration function is typically given to you or can be derived from Newton's law. This expression will always be a function of time,position, and/or velocity and must be re-evaluated every time you advance by a time step.\n",
        "   2. Use a kinematic equation to calculate the next position using the previous position and velocity.\n",
        "   3. Use a kinematic equation to calculate the next velocity using the previous position and velocity.\n",
