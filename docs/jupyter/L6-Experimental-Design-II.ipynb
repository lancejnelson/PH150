        "### Standing Waves\n",
        "Standing waves result from making waves that reflect back on themselves, or by making waves on both ends of a string. When we were children we formed a type of standing wave with jump ropes.\n",

        "</div>\n",
        "\n",
        "This standing wave had a part that went up and down in the middle and two parts that did not move much on each end (called nodes). But if you had a bored kid, you might have seen a standing wave that looks like this.\n",
        "\n",
        "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
        "<img src=\"https://lancejnelson.github.io/PH150/figures/JumpRope2ndHar.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
        "</div>\n",
        "\n",
        "This is not so good for jumping, but makes an interesting picture. The part in the middle that does not seem to be moving is called a node. Really there are also nodes on each end of the rope as well. So altogether there are three nodes in this picture. We can make standing waves that have many nodes. If you try this with a jump rope, you will find that the more nodes you have, the faster you have to shake your end of the rope. Another way to say this is that the frequency of your wave you are making must increase with the number of nodes. This is part of today’s model.\n",
        "In the setup on your table, ring stands are holding strings, and there is an oscillator on one end that has a frequency control box. The other end has a pulley and a hanging mass to provide tension on the string.\n",

        "      \n",
        "Experimentally we find that not all frequencies will make standing waves. So our model includes the idea that only some frequencies produce standing waves. Our model also includes the idea that the weight of the string will change which frequency will make a standing wave. If you play a stringed instrument, you may have noticed that some strings are thicker than others. Thicker strings have different standing wave frequencies than thinner strings. If you study this model (some of you will in PH123), you can derive an equation that tells which frequencies will work $$f={n\\over 2L} \\sqrt{ Mg\\over \\mu}$$\n",
        "where n is an integer ($n = 1, 2, 3 \\dots$). This integer for strings is the number of nodes minus one $n = n_\\text{nodes} − 1$. So you can form a standing wave, then count the places that don’t seem to move (remember the ends!) and subtract one to find n. The frequency that creates the standing wave should be a function of $n$. **Our model tells us that if we know n, we should be able to predict the frequency.** You will find that for each way you can make a standing wave, a small range of frequencies will make the standing wave, not just one, single frequency. But the frequency that produces the largest standing wave is the one we want (biggest amplitude–or the one for which the wave looks bigger) . That was the $f$ that was included in forming our model equation. Of course there are other variables in our equation, so we should find out what they are. \n",
        "\n",
        "The quantity $\\mu$ is the linear mass density. It is defined as mass of the string divided by the length of the string. So μ tells us how massive the string is.\n",
        "The quantity $L$ is the length of the string that is participating in the waving,\n",
        "$g = 9.8004$ m/s$^2$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $M$ is the hanging mass tied to the end of the string beyond the pulley.\n",
        "One way we could verify our model equation is to use it to predict one of the input values. Let’s use $\\mu$. **The idea is to use our model equation to somehow find μ and then measure μ to see if the model equation prediction is good.**\n",
        "\n",
        " Last week we learned that we can take more than one measurement, and use those measurements together with a curve fit to solve for a fit parameter. The quantity $\\mu$ should be in one of the fit parameters. Then you can solve for $\\mu$ using the fit parameter given by your Python linear fit code. This is a more robust way to find $\\mu$, and it is the way I want you to proceed.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may have to adjust the amplitude knob on the frequency controller for some frequencies to keep the apparatus from shaking itself apart. The frequency controller has a fine and a course frequency adjust knob, and a digital frequency display.\n",

        "### Research Proposal\n",
        "At the end of the semester you will be asked to design and carry out a high-quality physics experiment.  As part of that process you will submit a research proposal.  A proposal is a document that is intended to persuade someone (your professor, funding agency, yourself, etc.) that you should be given the\n",
        "resources and support to perform the experiment. For our class, the proposal\n",
        "consists of the following parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Statement of the experimental problem\n",
        "2. Procedures and anticipated difficulties\n",
        "3. Proposed analysis and expected results\n",
        "4. Preliminary List of equipment needed\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that most of the steps involved in planning an experiment are contained\n",
        "in these four parts of the proposal. Each of the steps is explained in more\n",
        "detail below.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Statement of the experimental problem\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a physics class, so our experiment should be a physics experiment.\n",
        "The job of an experimental physicist is to test physics models. So your\n",
        "statement of the experimental problem should include what model you are\n",
        "testing and a brief, high level, overview of what you plan to do to test\n",
        "this model.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Procedures and anticipated difficulties\n",
        "\n",
        "Hopefully, your reader will be so excited by the thought of you solving your\n",
        "experimental problem that he or she will want to know the details of what\n",
        "you plan to do. You should describe in some detail what you are planning. If\n",
        "there are hard parts of the procedure, tell how you plan to get through\n",
        "them. This is essentially steps 1-6 of our experimental design strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Proposed analysis and expected results\n",
        "\n",
        "You might think this is unfair, how are you supposed to know what analysis\n",
        "will be needed and what the results should be until you take the data? But\n",
        "really you both can, and should make a good plan for your data analysis and\n",
        "figure out what your expected results should be before you start taking\n",
        "data. After all, you have a model you are testing. You can encapsulate that\n",
        "model into a predictive equation for your experiment. Then you can use that\n",
        "predictive equation to obtain predicted results and uncertainties. Using\n",
        "this, you can design your experimental apparatus by putting in the numbers\n",
        "from your experimental design and seeing what the outcome should be. You can\n",
        "see if there is a chance that your experiment will measure what you want\n",
        "with the equipment you have (this is where our differential form of error\n",
        "calculation comes in).\n",
        "\n",
        "If you don't do this, you don't know what equipment you will need or how\n",
        "sensitive that equipment needs to be. If you are trying to measure the size\n",
        "of your text book, an odometer that only measures in whole miles may not be\n",
        "the best choice of equipment. This might be obvious, but depending on how\n",
        "well you need to measure your text book, a ruler may not work either. You\n",
        "don't know until you have an estimate of the uncertainty. So to know what\n",
        "you need, do the calculations in advance with your range of inputs as the\n",
        "values you take for the prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course this means you must include a predictive calculation of the\n",
        "uncertainty. Uncertainty in your result is governed by the uncertainty\n",
        "inherent in the measurements you will take. The uncertainty calculation\n",
        "tells you what sensitivity you will need in your measurement devices. In our\n",
        "text book case, you could see immediately that you need a different\n",
        "apparatus than the odometer. You might also find our ruler to be problematic\n",
        "depending on what precision you need.\n",
        "\n",
        "I remember a time in my career when the US Naval Research Labs asked us to\n",
        "build a microwave radiometer to measure the sea wind direction from space.\n",
        "We spent some time and our predicted analysis and uncertainty said that it\n",
        "would be a very expensive instrument to be able to successfully measure the\n",
        "wind direction---it would take more money than they were offering. NRL\n",
        "disagreed and built the device themselves at less cost, but to lesser\n",
        "specifications with much greater uncertainties. Then they spent a billion\n",
        "(yes, a billion with a \"b\" ) dollars to\n",
        "launch the device into space. The device was a total failure. The\n",
        "uncertainty was so big that the data was totally useless. We want to find\n",
        "out whether our experiment will work before we risk our grades (or a billion\n",
        "dollars) on it. So we will do the prediction ahead of taking the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "You should do all of this symbolically if you can, numerically if you must,\n",
        "but almost never by hand giving single value results. Some measurements will\n",
        "come back poorer than you anticipated, or some piece of equipment will be\n",
        "unavailable. You don't want to have to redo all your calculations from\n",
        "scratch each time this happens. For example, in the event of an equipment\n",
        "problem, your analysis tells you if another piece of equipment is\n",
        "sufficiently sensitive, or if you need to find an exact replacement. When I\n",
        "perform an analysis like this, I try for a symbolic equation for\n",
        "uncertainty. I like to program these equations into Scientific Workplace,\n",
        "or Maple, or SAGE, or MathCAD, or Mathematica or whatever symbolic math\n",
        "processor I have. Then, as actual measurements change, I instantly get new\n",
        "predictions. In the absence of a symbolic package, a python script or a spreadsheet program\n",
        "will do fine (and we have Excel on our computers). A numerical program also\n",
        "is quick and easy to re-run with new numbers when no symbolic answer is\n",
