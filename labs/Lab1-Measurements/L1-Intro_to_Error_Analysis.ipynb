        "measurements will be at the heart of any experiment you do. Measuring\n",
        "involves the use of a measuring device of some sort, such as a ruler,\n",
        "balance, microphone, voltmeter, or any other sensor.  When measuring a\n",

        "All measuring devices fall into one of two categories: analog and\n",
        "digital.  Analog devices usually have a set of tick marks and a scale\n",
        "printed on them.  Meter sticks, spring scales, calipers, multimeters\n",

        "a meter stick to measure the length of a rod.  If you look close,\n",
        "you'll notice that the end of the rod falls between the tick marks on\n",
        "the meter stick. Such will almost always be the case. If you were to look\n",
        "really close, you'd notice that the tick marks themselves have finite\n",
        "width.  Therefore, even if the end of the rod landed on a tick mark,\n",
        "you still wouldn't know which part of the tick mark it was.  Every\n",

        "range of values that we are sure will include the true value.  In this example, a range\n",
        "of $(97.6-97.7)$ would certainly include the correct value, but this\n",
        "range is probably too broad.  On the other hand, choosing a range of\n",
        "$(97.64-97.66)$ might be too small so as to not actually include the\n",
        "true value.  The correct length is probably $97.65$ with\n",

        "Measurements made from digital devices will carry uncertainty too.\n",

        "so that it fits on the digital readout.  Uncertainty\n",

        "For example, suppose that you measure the mass of an object\n",
        "on a digital scale and it reads $10.55$ kg.  The actual value of the\n",
        "measurement could have been as low as $10.545$ kg or as high as\n",
        "$10.555$ kg. Anything in that range would have rounded to $10.55$ kg.\n",
        "Hence, the uncertainty on this measurement is $\\pm 0.005$\n",
        "kg.  This measurement would be reported as $10.55 \\pm .005$ kg.  In\n",

        "\n",
        "In science, we use two terms that often can cause confusion, since in\n",
        "everyday language they tend to be synonymous. They are precision and\n",
        "accuracy.  Precision is a measure of the uncertainty in a measurement.\n",
        "In other words, high precision means low uncertainty. Accuracy, on the other hand, means a measurement agrees well with an accepted standard. The figure below illustrates the concept of precision vs. accuracy when throwing darts at a dartboard.   \n",
        "\n",
        "When  all of your measurements are offset from the true value we call it a *systematic error*. The blue dots in the figure are an example of a systematic error. An example of a systematic error would involve using a measuring tape that is unusually hot and has therefore thermally expanded so that it is longer than it normally is.  Taking measurements with this device will give readings that are always smaller than they should be.  There is no way to detect a systematic error by gathering data; you must uncover it based on the experimental circumstances. \n",

        "\n",

        "physics textbook that are given to you without any $\\pm$ value\n",
        "attached to them.  In the absence of an explicitly-stated uncertainty,\n",
        "it is generally assumed that the uncertainty is $\\pm 5$ on the digit\n",
        "that is one beyond the least significant digit. For example, if your\n",
        "homework problem states that a car was traveling with speed $25$ m/s, it is implied that\n",
        "the uncertainty on that length is $\\pm 0.5$ m/s. After all, if the true\n",
        "value were anywhere in the range $(24.5 - 25.5)$, we would have\n",
        "rounded the final answer to $25$ m/s. \n",
        "\n",
        "The numbers used to communicate the precision of a measurement are\n",
        "called significant figures. The rules for tracking and reporting of\n",
        "significant figures that you learn in physics and chemistry class are\n",
        "a quick and dirty way to keep track of these uncertainties as they are\n",
        "used to perform calculations.  They ensure that the implied\n",
        "uncertainty in a calculated value is not wildly incongruent with the\n",
        "uncertainty in the data provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, using significant figures to communicate uncertainty does\n",

        "length of a rod and determine that lies in the range $(10.5 - 10.6)$\n",
        "cm.  In other words, you would report the length of the rod to be\n",

        "implying that the actual value is somewhere in the range of $(10.45 -\n",
        "10.55)$ which isn't the correct window.  If you report the length to\n",
        "be $10.55$ cm, you're implying that the value is somewhere in the\n",
        "range $(10.545 - 10.555)$ cm, which is too narrow.  We use significant\n",

        "close, but not perfect.\n",
        "\n",
        "The number of significant figures that a number has is an indication of its fractional uncertainty.  For example, if you report your mass to be $m = 75$ kg, you are implying an uncertainty of $\\pm .5$ and thus a fractional uncertainty of ${.5 \\over 75} = 0.7\\%$. But if you report your mass to be $m = 75.1$ kg you are implying an uncertainty of $\\pm .05$ and thus a fractional uncertainty of ${.05 \\over 75} = 0.07\\%$.  Roughly speaking for each significant figure that is gained the fractional uncertainty decreases by an order of magnitude.
