    "## Notes to Grader:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activity I\n",
    "1. No big deductions on this first lab unless work is missing. Students are likely to struggle assigning appropriate uncertainties to their measurements.  If they do so, add a small deduction and include an explanation about why their uncertainties were too small.\n",
    "2. The students' numbers won't be exactly what I have here. The only time to worry at all is if the uncertainties differ from mine by one or more orders of magnitude.\n",
    "3. The top and bottom of the block were not cut very precisely and as are result are not perfectly flat. (done intentionally) When measuring the dimensions of the block and assigning uncertainties, students often underestimate the uncertainty on the height of the block.  Check this and if their uncertainty differs from mine by one or more orders of magnitude, point it out to them and add a small penalty. \n",
    "4. No big penalties for mistakes like the one described above yet.  If the student didn't complete a part of the lab, you can deduct the appropriate amount.\n",
    "5. If you deduct points, always explain the mistake.\n",
    "6. Check to make sure they filled out the markdown table with their results.\n",
    "7. Their code may look slightly different from mine and that is OK as long as what the did is equivalent to what I did.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activity II\n",
    "1. As in activity I, don't expect their numbers to match mine with exactness.  The key thing is that they assign uncertainties of the appropriate magnitude.\n",
    "1. Students will often underestimate the uncertainties on the room measurements. Uncertainties in these measurements are due to:\n",
    "    1. Slack in the flexible tape.\n",
    "    2. Not measuring along a line perpendicular to the wall.\n",
    "    3. Neglecting the width of the tile.\n",
    "    4. Reading the tick marks on the flexible tape. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The uncertainty should be on the order of 5 - 10 cm.  If the student's uncertainty differs by one or more orders of magnitude, point it out, explain why the uncertainty should be bigger, and apply a small deduction.   \n",
    "2. Big deductions are only for missing work.\n",
    "3. The students were instructed to compare their results to the other groups and comment on why their results agree with or don't agree with the others.  Check that they included a high quality comment at the indicated location. They'll know if their results agree with the others because the error bars will overlap. Common reasons for disagreement are underestimating uncertainties which leads to error bars that are too short.\n",
    "4. Their code may look slightly different from mine and that is OK as long as what the did is equivalent to what I did.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab you will learn the basics of uncertainty estimation and uncertainty propagation.  Occasionally, you'll be asked to show your mathematical work for a calculation. [Here](https://www.caam.rice.edu/~heinken/latex/symbols.pdf) is a reference you can use for entering math symbols.  [This](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/LaTeX_Math_Symbols.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index) is a good one too.\n",

    "## Activity I (50 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equipment:\n",
    "1. Metal block and cylinder\n",
    "2. Balance scale.\n",
    "3. Caliper or ruler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal: \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be given a metal block and a metal cylinder. Both objects are made of the same material.  You will be allowed to measure the __dimensions__ and __mass__ of the **cylinder** but only the dimensions of the block.  Your goal is to accurately predict the mass of the block with its associated uncertainty.  If the true mass of the block falls within your uncertainty window, the experiment is a success. \n",
    "\n",
    "Important: **You cannot directly measure the mass of the block**.  The instructor will take this measurement.\n",

    "\n",

    "### Procedure:\n",
    "Carefully follow the steps below to accomplish your task\n",
    "#### Calculate Density of Cylinder  (15 points)\n",
    "   1. Using the caliper, measure the dimensions of the metal **cylinder**.  Enter the values and the uncertainties into the code cell provided below.\n",
    "   2. (5 pts) Assign uncertainties to the measurements made in step one and record those uncertainties in the code cell provided below.\n",
    "   3.  Using the mechanical balance, measure the mass of the **cylinder**. \n",

    "   2. Calculate the percentage error for your prediction.\n",
    "   3. Modify the table below to include your results for this experiment. \n",
