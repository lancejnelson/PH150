## Background Information

### Standing Waves
Standing waves result from making waves that reflect back on themselves, or by making waves on both ends of a string. When we were children we formed a type of standing wave with jump ropes.

</div>

This standing wave had a part that went up and down in the middle and two parts that did not move much on each end (called nodes). But if you had a bored kid, you might have seen a standing wave that looks like this.

</div>

This is not so good for jumping, but makes an interesting picture. The part in the middle that does not seem to be moving is called a node. Really there are also nodes on each end of the rope as well. So altogether there are three nodes in this picture. We can make standing waves that have many nodes. If you try this with a jump rope, you will find that the more nodes you have, the faster you have to shake your end of the rope. Another way to say this is that the frequency of your wave you are making must increase with the number of nodes. This is part of today’s model.
In the setup on your table, ring stands are holding strings, and there is an oscillator on one end that has a frequency control box. The other end has a pulley and a hanging mass to provide tension on the string.

Experimentally we find that not all frequencies will make standing waves. So our model includes the idea that only some frequencies produce standing waves. Our model also includes the idea that the weight of the string will change which frequency will make a standing wave. If you play a stringed instrument, you may have noticed that some strings are thicker than others. Thicker strings have different standing wave frequencies than thinner strings. If you study this model (some of you will in PH123), you can derive an equation that tells which frequencies will work $$f={n\over 2L} \sqrt{ Mg\over \mu}$$
where n is an integer ($n = 1, 2, 3 \dots$). This integer for strings is the number of nodes minus one $n = n_\text{nodes} − 1$. So you can form a standing wave, then count the places that don’t seem to move (remember the ends!) and subtract one to find n. The frequency that creates the standing wave should be a function of $n$. **Our model tells us that if we know n, we should be able to predict the frequency.** You will find that for each way you can make a standing wave, a small range of frequencies will make the standing wave, not just one, single frequency. But the frequency that produces the largest standing wave is the one we want (biggest amplitude–or the one for which the wave looks bigger) . That was the $f$ that was included in forming our model equation. Of course there are other variables in our equation, so we should find out what they are. 

The quantity $\mu$ is the linear mass density. It is defined as mass of the string divided by the length of the string. So μ tells us how massive the string is.
The quantity $L$ is the length of the string that is participating in the waving,
$g = 9.8004$ m/s$^2$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $M$ is the hanging mass tied to the end of the string beyond the pulley.
One way we could verify our model equation is to use it to predict one of the input values. Let’s use $\mu$. **The idea is to use our model equation to somehow find μ and then measure μ to see if the model equation prediction is good.**

 Last week we learned that we can take more than one measurement, and use those measurements together with a curve fit to solve for a fit parameter. The quantity $\mu$ should be in one of the fit parameters. Then you can solve for $\mu$ using the fit parameter given by your Python linear fit code. This is a more robust way to find $\mu$, and it is the way I want you to proceed.

You may have to adjust the amplitude knob on the frequency controller for some frequencies to keep the apparatus from shaking itself apart. The frequency controller has a fine and a course frequency adjust knob, and a digital frequency display.


### Research Proposal
At the end of the semester you will be asked to design and carry out a high-quality physics experiment.  As part of that process you will submit a research proposal.  A proposal is a document that is intended to persuade someone (your professor, funding agency, yourself, etc.) that you should be given the
resources and support to perform the experiment. For our class, the proposal
consists of the following parts:

1. Statement of the experimental problem
2. Procedures and anticipated difficulties
3. Proposed analysis and expected results
4. Preliminary List of equipment needed

Note that most of the steps involved in planning an experiment are contained
in these four parts of the proposal. Each of the steps is explained in more
detail below.

#### Statement of the experimental problem

This is a physics class, so our experiment should be a physics experiment.
The job of an experimental physicist is to test physics models. So your
statement of the experimental problem should include what model you are
testing and a brief, high level, overview of what you plan to do to test
this model.

#### Procedures and anticipated difficulties

Hopefully, your reader will be so excited by the thought of you solving your
experimental problem that he or she will want to know the details of what
you plan to do. You should describe in some detail what you are planning. If
there are hard parts of the procedure, tell how you plan to get through
them. This is essentially steps 1-6 of our experimental design strategy.

#### Proposed analysis and expected results

You might think this is unfair, how are you supposed to know what analysis
will be needed and what the results should be until you take the data? But
really you both can, and should make a good plan for your data analysis and
figure out what your expected results should be before you start taking
data. After all, you have a model you are testing. You can encapsulate that
model into a predictive equation for your experiment. Then you can use that
predictive equation to obtain predicted results and uncertainties. Using
this, you can design your experimental apparatus by putting in the numbers
from your experimental design and seeing what the outcome should be. You can
see if there is a chance that your experiment will measure what you want
with the equipment you have (this is where our differential form of error
calculation comes in).

If you don't do this, you don't know what equipment you will need or how
sensitive that equipment needs to be. If you are trying to measure the size
of your text book, an odometer that only measures in whole miles may not be
the best choice of equipment. This might be obvious, but depending on how
well you need to measure your text book, a ruler may not work either. You
don't know until you have an estimate of the uncertainty. So to know what
you need, do the calculations in advance with your range of inputs as the
values you take for the prediction.

Of course this means you must include a predictive calculation of the
uncertainty. Uncertainty in your result is governed by the uncertainty
inherent in the measurements you will take. The uncertainty calculation
tells you what sensitivity you will need in your measurement devices. In our
text book case, you could see immediately that you need a different
apparatus than the odometer. You might also find our ruler to be problematic
depending on what precision you need.

I remember a time in my career when the US Naval Research Labs asked us to
build a microwave radiometer to measure the sea wind direction from space.
We spent some time and our predicted analysis and uncertainty said that it
would be a very expensive instrument to be able to successfully measure the
wind direction---it would take more money than they were offering. NRL
disagreed and built the device themselves at less cost, but to lesser
specifications with much greater uncertainties. Then they spent a billion
(yes, a billion with a "b" ) dollars to
launch the device into space. The device was a total failure. The
uncertainty was so big that the data was totally useless. We want to find
out whether our experiment will work before we risk our grades (or a billion
dollars) on it. So we will do the prediction ahead of taking the data.

You should do all of this symbolically if you can, numerically if you must,
but almost never by hand giving single value results. Some measurements will
come back poorer than you anticipated, or some piece of equipment will be
unavailable. You don't want to have to redo all your calculations from
scratch each time this happens. For example, in the event of an equipment
problem, your analysis tells you if another piece of equipment is
sufficiently sensitive, or if you need to find an exact replacement. When I
perform an analysis like this, I try for a symbolic equation for
uncertainty. I like to program these equations into Scientific Workplace,
or Maple, or SAGE, or MathCAD, or Mathematica or whatever symbolic math
processor I have. Then, as actual measurements change, I instantly get new
predictions. In the absence of a symbolic package, a python script or a spreadsheet program
will do fine (and we have Excel on our computers). A numerical program also
is quick and easy to re-run with new numbers when no symbolic answer is
found.

#### Preliminary List of equipment needed

Once you have done your analysis, you are ready to list the equipment you
need and the sensitivity of the equipment you need (that is, list the
uncertainties you need to achieve). Final approval of the project and the
ultimate success of your experiment depends on the equipment you choose or
are granted. You want to do a good job analyzing so you know what you need,
and a good job describing the experiment so you are likely to have the
equipment you want available when you start.

#### Performing the experiment

Once your proposal is accepted, I will provide you with the equipment we
have agreed upon from your proposal. You will have three weeks to perform
your experimentation. I will be available for advice and to watch for
problems or safety issues. But you and your team will perform the
experiment. **You will want to keep good notes in your lab notebook.**
You will likely have to change your procedure after you start because of
problems. Take careful note of what was actually done, and what your
measurements were. Give the reason for the change. Note any unusual things
that happen. **Carefully record what you do.**

#### Written Report
The written report is designed to match a normal format for an applied
physics article in a journal like \emph{Applied Optics} or the \emph{IEEE
Transactions} journals. It is useful to know now how I will grade
the report later so you can make sure you design in all the parts I will
look for. There should be an introduction, description of the procedure,
description of the data and results, a description of the analysis, and a
conclusion. These sections are described in detail in the following table.

Experimentation is a lot of fun if done right. It can be frustrating and
discouraging if not done well. Our goal is to learn how to perform and
report on an experiment, so that is what will be graded. If you show
something new and interesting, that is just more fun. If you show that your
original model was not correct--that is science! If you have done a good job
designing and reporting your experiment, a negative result is just as good
as a positive result.
